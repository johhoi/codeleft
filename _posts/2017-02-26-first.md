title: Not Naming it Socialist Software
layout: post
---

So what about the name then. Originally the idea was to be more explicit in a particular definition of the political left, such as socialist software or communist code (because alliterations are always fun!) or similar. However, after given it some thought it was decided that it might be better to be non explicit in order to not alienate anyone with a particular mind set and also, possibly mainly, codeleft.org was a much shorter URL. It is also nice to have something that works in the imperative sense as well; Create **Code** for the political **Left**!

It is obvious that this post might alienate people anyway just by mentioning certain political -isms, heavy with connotations, but this project is about real issues for the future of our society and it will require knowledgeable and politically conscious people to help out. Mucking about with semantics should not be the focus. So even though this project really is about socialist software, let's stick to that the prettier domain name wins the argument and leave it at that?

title: Some background and current plans

So the idealogical background to this site is in short that I was and am still looking for software projects that I could help out with. But it was and is important to me that the project in question somehow improves society in a way that fits my political point of view. Without that it wouldn't feel meaningful enough. Since I couldn't find any projects that fit the bill I decided to start collecting them and also, since I hope I am not alone with my ambitions, to publish the findings and ask for help from others. 

Currently, I am looking towards completing the following technical items for the site:

* Adding RSS feed
* Migrating from Github as a host to self-hosting on a VPS somewhere
* After migration, adding support for HTTPS via LetsEncrypt (Github Pages doesnâ€™t allow HTTPS for custom domains)
* Change layout to be mobile friendly (especially looking for a way to do that without using scripts if possible!)

But of course, further relevant projects with left leaning code needs to be found and added as well.

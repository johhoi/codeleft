[Zetkin](http://zetkin.org/en/) is a tool developed by Swedish socialist party VÃ¤nsterpartiet, used successfully to drastically increase participation. Zetkin contains several tools to organize activism more efficiently. 

The tools are for example:
- support for systematic calling
- campaign managment
- activist administration
- simple participation

The frontend is [open source](https://github.com/zetkin) and they are looking for help! The backend is also open for interested coders, but requires you to go via making contact with [the foundation](http://zetkin.org/en/zetkin/) running the system.

title: Not Naming it Socialist Software

So what about the name then. Originally the idea was to be more explicit in a particular definition of the political left, such as Socialist Software or Communist Code (because alliterations are always fun!) or similar. However, codeleft.org was a much shorter URL which won over and it's always nice not to explicitly exclude any -isms. It is also catchy to have something that works in the imperative sense as well; Create **Code** for the political **Left**!

This is about real issues for the future of our society and it will require knowledgeable and politically conscious people to help out. The prettier domain name wins the day, but I guess you really should call this a place for Socialist Software.

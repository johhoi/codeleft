## Welcome to CodeLeft
CodeLeft is about coding and where it crosses the political left. It is a starting point for on the one hand help people already decided to find out how they can help out and on the other hand to invigorate people to actually get involved.

The idea of this site is to collect and link code projects that either are directly political or that could be a tool for people being directly political.

### Please help out
This project will require input from a lot of people if it is to flourish, so please help out if you can!

### How it is built
CodeLeft uses Github Pages which is running Jekyll. Jekyll translates Markdown files into HTML which are then hosted by Github Pages.

# About CodeLeft

This site is about coding and where it crosses the political left. It is a starting point for on the one hand help people already decided to find out how they can help out and on the other hand to invigorate people to actually get involved.

The idea of this site is to collect and link code projects that either are directly political or that could be a tool for people being directly political.

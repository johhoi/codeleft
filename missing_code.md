# Missing Code
What code does the political left require? Do you have any ideas? Add ideas either through getting involved in this [page directly](https://github.com/johhoi/codeleft/) or contact us on twitter ([@codeleft_org](https://twitter.com/Codeleft_org)).

Here are some ideas, maybe one of them could be initiated by you?

* Machine Learning / AI for union negotiation
    - After making an algorithm engine called [Libratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libratus) that beat humans at Chess, Go and now Poker the next step and commercialisation of this engine is for it to be able to win corporate negotiations. Thus, in order for unions to keep up further work is required.

* Barcode reader for political content in products
    - Normal barcode readers give information about a product's price. Sometimes you need more though; How was this produced? Where was it produced? How was it transported here?
